# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Within this project I will create a dynamic table based upon a fictional dataset (/static/js/data.js). This table will allow users to pull data in and filter it for specific values. To accomplish this I will use JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Create an HTML web page.

* Append a table to the web page that adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* JavaScript code that listens for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
