# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Within this project I will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided (/static/js/data.js). This table will allow users to filter the data for specific values. To accomplish this I will use JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Create a basic HTML web page.

* Append a table to the web page that adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Create columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
